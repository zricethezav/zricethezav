Maintaining [gitleaks](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks) is hard work and a little bit of $$$ will motivate me to continue maintaining and adding features to the project. Won't you be my ~~neighbor~~ [sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/zricethezav)?

I'll also offer some of my time to you if you're a ðŸ’¸ big baller ðŸ’¸  and spend at least $500/mo. This time can be used for setting up gitleaks in a CI environment, writing new rules, debugging gitleaks issues, or working on new features. 

Or if you're a crypto millionaire why dontcha send this nice midwesterner some btc
